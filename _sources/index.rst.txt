Compas Toolkit
===============

The Compas Toolkit is a high-performance C++ library offering GPU-accelerated functions for use in quantitative MRI research.
The toolkit offers fast simulations of various MRI sequences and k-space trajectories commonly used in qMRI studies.
While the core of the toolkit is implemented using CUDA, the functionality is accessible from both C++ and Julia.


Features
--------

* Flexible API that can be composed in different ways.
* Highly tuned GPU kernels that provide high performance.
* Implemented using CUDA, optimized for Nvidia GPUs.
* Usable from Julia and C++.

Usage
-----

To use the Compas Toolkit in Julia, simply build the Julia bindings using the instructions above and then add the directory ``CompasToolkit.jl`` to you Julia project.

.. code-block:: julia

   using Pkg; Pkg.add(path="<path to compas-toolkit>/CompasToolkit.jl/")


You can then import the library with ``using CompasToolkit``.

For examples of using the toolkit, take a look at the scripts available in the ``CompasToolkit.jl/tests`` directory.
